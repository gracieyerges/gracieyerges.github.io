        <p class="padding2">For my Elizabot, I wanted to give it more of a realistic feel. I changed it so that it was more
          like a middle aged mom than a robotic therapist. I added more language that feels reminiscent of what my mom would
          say and I added nicknames that moms in movies and tv shows use. I think changing this makes it easier to talk to
          because you feel a little more connected to it since it’s calling you sweetheart and darling. I changed the bots name
           to Amanda because I know a lot of middle aged moms named Amanda and thought it was the perfect fit. I kept the therapist
            tone for the bot because I felt like it made it a little more difficult as I had to really think about how moms would react
             to certain things and because I’m not a mom, it made it harder to decide what seemed realistic. Some of the phrases that I
             changed still sound a little formal. As much as I tried, I couldn’t think of a way to make them come out more informal and
             some of them still feel too similar to what the bot was already programmed to say. I tried to change it as much as possible,
              but some of them there was no way to make a big difference, there’s only so much you can do with words and the English language.</p>
