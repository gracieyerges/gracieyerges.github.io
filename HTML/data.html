  <p class="padding2">This is a visual representation of a weeks worth of data that I recorded. For a whole week I tracked how often I played with my jewelry. I also recorded what piece of jewelry it was, where I was when I was playing with it, and what I was feeling in that moment. Through recording this data, I learned that I tend to play with my ring the most, with my earrings a close second.
  I had problems with pinpointing exactly what I was feeling in the moment as a lot of the time there was no overwhelming emotion. My best guess is that I fidget to get any sort of energy out, which I took note of as "fidgeting" when visualizing the results. Through tracking the week, I learned that playing with my jewelry can be a comforting thing. This week in particular highlighted this as I had a
test on the Tuesday of that week. I also found a pattern in which classes tended to create the habit of playing with my jewelry. The biggest thing I found was that it showed me that I spend way too much time in my room, a habit that I am currently trying to break.</p>
