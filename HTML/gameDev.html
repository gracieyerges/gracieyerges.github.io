<p class="padding2">I made a game that is about the roads in Pennsylvania and how difficult or how rough the roads can be. There are potholes and construction zones that the player will have to drive through as well as backroads that are very narrow and have no lines but are meant to be a two way (although we all know they shouldn’t be). The game targets the problem of the roads in Pennsylvania or at least the worst parts of the roads in Pennsylvania. The player will have at least two choices when coming across these obstacles, one will be the better choice, it may be very obvious or it may just be the slightly safer thing to do.
I used css to create an image of a road that is moving, and it seems like an endless road. I figured this made sense because it is a driving game. I used a blue color for the rest of the background to be representative of the sky or at least remind people of the sky. I added a picture of the Triple AAA logo when I mention it partly because when I wrote that passage I thought it was funny, but it also gives the player the visual if they can’t remember what Triple AAA is. I changed the color for the word “construction zone” because when you pass one it is always orange, so I figured the color would be close to the actual orange they use. I made the first “right” and “left” options buttons, in my mind kind of like blinkers, however they are not quite blinker shaped, but if the player has a good imagination then it works. Most of the first words for each passage are bolded and they are some version of simple “good idea” or “wrong choice”. I thought this would make it easier for the player to clearly see if they made a good decision or not. I also bolded and used a different font for the word “congratulations” at the beginning of the game, as it makes it feel a little more celebratory, which is the feeling that people are meant to feel when they get their drivers license.
	The beginning of the game lets the player choose what car they want to imagine driving. They have multiple brand options, but not specific builds for the cars. I considered allowing them to type in what car they wanted, but then considering some people barely know the brand names, I figured it was simpler for the player. The car they choose gets brought into the game at multiple points, and when they make a choice that could damage the car, it does count the damage. I also created a variable that would count the amount of tickets the player would get from speeding or during any accident. After I added the variable to count the number of tickets, I also added a variable to count the amount of good choices the player makes. This way they would be able to see the positive parts of what they are doing. </p>
