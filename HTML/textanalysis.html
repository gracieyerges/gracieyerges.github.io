      <h2 class="padding2"> Reading Hans Christen Andersen stories through text encoding and Voyant</h2>
        <p class="padding5">For my text analysis, I chose to look at 5 different stories
        written by Hans Christian Andersen. Four out of my five texts include multiple
        different fairytales within their own text. The fifth one I chose was an autobiography,
        written by Andersen before the rest of my corpus was published. I wanted to use these
         texts and compare Andersen’s writing throughout them all. Using Voyant as well as the work
         I did with encoding one of the stories, I found some things that Andersen does consistently
        throughout all of his work.</p>
<p class="padding5">Andersen’s work is very dialect heavy. Most of his stories are told through characters having conversations
 or characters telling the story themselves. This can be seen when looking at the trends section in Voyant.</p>
<iframe class="padding6"style='width: 506px; height: 426px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?stopList=keywords-bedab96eb95bae52ae5433a96840eb78&query=said&query=little&query=old&query=like&query=came&withDistributions=raw&corpus=1ee09c0710dac739cf15d633cdc4629a'></iframe>
<p class="padding5">The word “said” is used a total of 1,663 times throughout all of the chosen texts.
  This graph also shows how strong the usage of “said” is. For example, on the graph you can see that
  “said” was written 630 times in What The Moon Saw: and Other Tales yet only written 41 times in The
   Nightingale. This also correlates with how long the documents are. What The Moon Saw is 147,417 words
   long, while Nightingale is only 3,650 words long. After doing some of my own calculations, this is
   almost equally proportionate in the usage of the word “said”. * The same can be said about the other
    most used words in Andersen’s works. They all are proportionate in usage to the length of the text.
   We would expect to see a word pop us less in a shorter story than a longer one because of the amount
   of space available to use that word.</p>
<p class="padding5">The graph can also show us the use of descriptive words that Andersen uses in his stories.
   The second and third most used words are “little” and “old” respectively.</p>
<iframe class="padding6"style='width: 506px; height: 426px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Cirrus/?stopList=keywords-bedab96eb95bae52ae5433a96840eb78&visible=150&corpus=1ee09c0710dac739cf15d633cdc4629a'></iframe>
<p class="padding5">If you look at some of the other words, we see “like” “came” and “good” are also highly used words in
these works. This can lead us to the assumption that Andersen likes to use descriptive words in his work
 a lot, which can also show an attention to detail or a well thought out story. These words also show a
  focus on the look, or age of the character, as “little” and “old” create a certain picture compared
   to “good” and “young”.</p>
<p class="padding5">In “The True Story of My Life” Andersen tells us about where he comes from.
   He describes the islands that are Denmark and gives a detailed explanation about his town.</p>
<code> &lt;My native land, Denmark, is a poetical land, full of popular traditions, old songs,
   and an eventful history, which has become bound up with that of Sweden and Norway. The Danish
    islands are possessed of beautiful beech woods, and corn and clover fields: they resemble
     gardens on a great scale. Upon one of these green islands, Funen, stands Odense, the place
      of my birth.&gt;</code>
<p class="padding5">Given the way he speaks about his hometown, and the fact that he uses it as a place
   setting in his stories, we can infer that he had a great love for the place he was born. He uses
    Odense as the setting for his story “The Bell’s Hollow”.</p>
<code> &lt;"Ding-dong! ding-dong!" sounded from <character name="the bell">the buried bell</character>
  in <place type="body of water" name= "Odense river">Odensee river.</place>What sort of a river is that?
   Every child in the town of <place type="city" name="Odense">Odensee</place> knows it.&gt;</code>
<p class="padding5">He also uses Odense in his story “The Bell-Deep”, which is like “The Bell’s Hollow”
   as the main character is a bell, but the story itself is fairly different.</p>
<p class="padding5">Looking at the characters of his stories, Andersen tends to lean towards characters
   that are not human, whether they be animals or inanimate objects, like a bell. He uses characters like
    a mouse, the birds, an apple branch, and the sunbeam. His story “The Quickest Runners” is a conversation
   between all animals and inanimate objects, there are no humans in his story at all. This is not to say
    that he doesn’t use humans as characters. There are plenty of stories that have humans as a side
    character and even the central character, however he seems to have a liking for nontraditional main
     characters. He also draws from mythical or magical characters. He uses elves, mermen, and goblins.</p>
<p class="padding5">It’s no surprise that Andersen’s stories are fairly popular, some of them being turned
   into Disney movies, like “The Emperor's New Clothes” being turned into “The Emperor’s New Groove” or
    “The Ugly Duckling”. His ability to tell a story through a lot of dialogue but also including enough
     detail to draw an image for the reader makes his stories fun and easy to read. His ability to draw
     from real life and add in abnormal main characters appeals to the audience, mainly children, although
      adults can find a sense of comfort in his stories. He knows how to write and you can see his writing
     did not vary drastically from year to year. Andersen knew what worked for his stories and he stuck
     to that.</p>


<p class="padding5">*Note: my calculations:
147,417 divided by 3,650 is about 40 while 630 divided by 41 is about 16.
 147,417 divided by 630 is about 234. 3,650 divided by 41 is about 89.
 40 divided by 16 is about 2 and a half and 234 divided by 89 is about 2 and a half
Therefore they are almost equal in usage of the word compared to length of text.</p>
